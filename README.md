# The Sona-Jo programming language

This is an ongoing project to design a simple functional language, and write a
compiler for it.


## Status

The project is still in the design phase, nothing is implemented.


## Motivation

- Functional programming, but closer to the hardware (with strict evaluation,
  type-classes, unboxed values and arrays as the main collection type, instead
  of linked lists).
- An ownership system similar to Rust, but without the focus on zero-cost
  abstractions (and all the complexity that come with it).

If you're curious, you can read more details about the project in the [documentation](docs/index.md).
