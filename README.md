# The Sona-Jo programming language

This is an ongoing project to design a simple functional language, and write a
compiler for it.


## Status

The project is still in the design phase, nothing is implemented.


## Motivation

- Functional programming, but using arrays as the main collection type (instead
  of linked lists).
- An ownership system like Rust, but without the hyper-focus on performance (and
  all the complexity that come with it).
