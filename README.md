# The Sona-Jo programming language

This is an ongoing project to design a pure functional language with an
ownership type system, and write a compiler for it.


## Status

The project is still in the design phase, *nothing is implemented*.



## Motivation

- Functional programming, but closer to the hardware than most existing
  functional languages.
- An ownership system for memory management, but without the focus on zero-cost
  abstractions and best-in-class performance that characterize Rust.

If you're curious, you can read more details about the project in the [documentation](docs/index.md).
