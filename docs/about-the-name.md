# About the name

Ciziel: pronunciation of the file extension ".czl", which was the abbreviation
of a former name of the project (Cozely).

## Old names

Sona-Jo is a coumpound word in [toki pona](https://tokipona.org/).  It can be
translated to "the understanding of ownership".

I initially called the language "Grace", after Grace Hopper, the computer
pioneer who wrote the first compiler. Unfortunately, the name was already taken
by another programming language.

The following quote from admiral Hopper served as a guiding line during the
initial design of the language:

> Humans are allergic to change. They love to say, "We've always done it this
> way." I try to fight that. That's why I have a clock on my wall that runs
> counter-clockwise.

I then briefly chose "Odo" as the new name in reference to the fictional
character from Ursula Le Guin's novel "The Dispossed" (and the short story "The
Day Before the Revolution"). At the time, the language was to use reference
counting (with the Perceus algorithm), so everything value was shared. That name
was *also* taken by another programming language. Plus, I switched back to
ownership for memory management, so it was not appropriate anymore.
