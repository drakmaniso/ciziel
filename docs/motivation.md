# Motivation

- strict evaluation (aka pass-by-value);
- arrays as the main collection type (instead of linked lists);
- **no** automatic currying of function;


Probably:
- open sum types;
- dot notation (i.e. functions associated to types);
- traits (i.e. simpler typeclasses) for generic programming;


Maybe:
- higher-order traits;
- compiler-tracked impurity (i.e. rudimentary effect system);
- mutation of local variables;
- effectful types for I/O;
- mutable reference type that allow side-effects (Box! with get! and set!);


Probably not (but worth considering):
- mutable value semantics;
