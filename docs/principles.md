# Principles


## A tool for reasoning

- Programs need to be easy to read and reason about, more than convenient to write.
- The language should help the programmer to build a mental model of the codebase.

Corresponding characteristics:
- orthogonality of features;
- low noise syntax;
- functions associated with types (aka methods);


## 

- Exploratory programming and refactoring are important.

Corresponding characteristics:
- static type checking, but with type inference
- immutability by default, but with optional mutability

## 

- Data is more important than code.

Correspongind characteristics:
- zero-cost data abstractions
