# Main characteristics of the language

- everything has value semantics
- data is immutable by default, with optional mutability
- static type checking with (local? global?) type inference
- union types for dynamic polymorphism
- generics and traits (aka typeclasses, protocols) for static polymorphism
- discourage type-level programming
- low-level data structures (aka zero cost abstrations for data), with higher level code
- encapsulation at the module level
- nominal records, structural unions and traits
- automatic generalization of methods for unions
- functions associated with types (aka methods);
