# Main characteristics of the language

- all variables and parameters have value semantics
- data is immutable by default, with optional mutability
- static type checking with (local? global?) type inference
- union types for dynamic polymorphism
- generics and traits (aka typeclasses, protocols) for static polymorphism
- nominal records, structural unions
- automatic generalization of methods for unions
- high-level code with low-level data structures (i.e. zero cost abstrations for data)
- functions associated with types (aka methods);
- encapsulation at the module level (and only there)
