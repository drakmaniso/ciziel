## Old names

I initially called the language "Grace", after Grace Hopper, the computer
pioneer who wrote the first compiler. Unfortunately, the name was already taken
by another programming language.

The following quote from admiral Hopper served as a guiding line during the
initial design of the language:

> Humans are allergic to change. They love to say, "We've always done it this
> way." I try to fight that. That's why I have a clock on my wall that runs
> counter-clockwise.


I then briefly chose "Odo" as the new name in reference to the fictional character from
Ursula Le Guin's novel "The Dispossed" (and the short story "The Day Before the
Revolution").
