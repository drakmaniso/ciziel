# Easy to read and easy to reason about

The main activity of a programmer is to *think* about code and data. When designing a programming language, it's tempting to make it convenient to write. But it's actually much more important to make it easy to read, and easy to reason about. The language should help the programmer build a mental model of the code-base.

Corresponding characteristics:

- functions associated with types (aka methods);
- encapsulation at module-level only;
- orthogonality of features;
- low noise syntax;
- no automatic currying;
- high-level code;
- immutable data (referential transparency);

Maybe:

- supports both imperative and functional style?
