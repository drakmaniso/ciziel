# The Odo programming language

Odo is a simple programming language with the following features:

- pure functions,
- type inference,
- ownership types,
- algebraic data types,
- nominal typing,
- explicit structural conversions,
- zero-cost data abstractions,
- generic programming,
- higher-kinded type constraints.


## Pure functions

aka data immutability


## Type inference

full?


## Ownership types

### Automatic static memory management

### Controlling side-effects

input/output via owned types rather than monads

### Safe concurrency


## Algebraic data types

aka sum types, tagged unions, enums


## Nominal typing


## Explicit structural conversion


## Zero-cost data abstractions

i.e. precise control of memory layout


## Generic programming


## Higher-kinded type constraints

aka generic constraints over type constructors

i.e. it is possible to define the concept of monads and functors in the type system
